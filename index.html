		<h3>PROJECT  DEVELOPMENT  EXPERIENCE</h3>
		<b>Fuel Tracking Application</b>
		<p>Using Android Studio with java to design and implement a simple fuel 		consumption tracking application, which maintains a basic log of fuel used for a 			particular car. Every log entry can shows the date, station, odometer, fuel grade, 			fuel amount and fuel unit cost. It is convenient for customer to check their Fuel 			Diary.
		</p>

		<b>POKEMON Bid Application</b>
		<p>Using Android Studio with Java to create a Pokemon bid application. User can 		uses our borrowing application to arrange trades of their Pokémon. Owners can put 			their properties on the list and set bids on their properties to earn 			money.Borrowers can pay the bids and borrow items that owners put on the list. 

		</p>
		<p>We have putted technology of Elasticsearch and Google Map into this 			application. Elasticsearch allow our users able to register their own account; at 			the same time, they can use Elasticsearch to search the Pokemon they are 			interested; Google map allow users to set their trading location.


		</p>

		<b>Online Photo Gallery</b>
		<p>Using development language PHP to develop an online photo sharing system called 			Online Photo Gallery. This Web Page allow users who connected the network of 			University of Alberta be able to share their photos to other users. In addition, 			we use database searching technology SQL to allow users be able to search photo or 			other users they are interested.
 

		</p>
		
		<b>SSR Distributed Social NetWorking</b>
                <p>Using Flask library in Python to develop the social NetWorking. The web is fundamentally interconnected and peer to peer.  If other social networks came up with an API we could link between them and use the social network we wanted. Furthermore we might gain some autonomy. This blogging/social network platform will allow the importing of other sources of posts (github, twitter, etc.) as well allow the distributing sharing of posts and content. User  sitting on one server can aggregate posts of their friends on other servers.</br> Here is the link <a href="http://ssrapptest1.herokuapp.com">http://ssrapptest1.herokuapp.com</a></p>
                <b>Machine Learning Project --Otto Group Product Classification Challenge</b>
                <p>This project is from the competition of Kaggle, our purpose is building the predictive model to distinguish between main product categories of Otto Group products. Firstly, we are using Gradient Boosting Trees, Gradient Boosting Logistic Regression, Neural Network and Random Forest to build stacking models in order to classify a dataset with 93 features for more than 200,000 products.  Secondly, we use folds for train dataset to predict the stacking models and generate which algorithm has the best classification score.</p>
